# ~/.xsessionrc is executed on Debian (and derivatives such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.)
# by the X startup scripts on a GUI login, for all session types and (I think) from 
# all display managers. It's also executed from startx if the user doesn't have a .xinitrc, 
# because in that case startx falls back on the same session startup scripts that 
# are used for GUI login. It's executed relatively early, after loading resources 
# but before starting any program such as a key agent, a D-Bus daemon, etc. 
# It typically sets variables that can be used by later startup scripts. 
# It doesn't have any official documentation that I know of, you have to dig into the 
# source to see what works.
